    I have been in desktop support for the past 20 years. With the changing landscape of technology, and everything shifting to cloud based services and virtual environments, the age fo the Desktop Support Analyst is about to see it's meteor fall
    from the sky! Because of this, I am embarking on changing career paths and stepping into the world of Full Stack Web Development. It has been a lot to process, and at times, quite frustrating, but overall I have not been as excited about learning
    something new as I am now in a long time. The satisfaction of figuring out what a line of code means, and does, or finally figuring out what has caused the error message, is extremely gratifying, and quite honestly, <strong>addicting!</strong>. I
    look forward to this journey and new stage of life!</p>
